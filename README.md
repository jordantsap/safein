#### IOS Review Information  
The app helps people that is registered customers to an accommodation service or hotel, that is given the right to use the app. Each hotel or accommodation service with the ability to use the service, holds a unique code-password, that can give to it's customers when they make a booking to them. Then, the customer who installed the app to his mobile phone, can request validation to connect the app with the booking provider, to be able to ask for help from the hotel or the accommodation service.
Each password is given to the hotels by us, after they provide us with the necessary details that are stored in a database that is used to hold accommodation details, phone, email, location, etc. These details are used by the app, in order to send sms and email, each time the app is used to ask for help.
App lifecycle:
First screen is a form with two fields, one for the authorization CODE and second for the user's PHONE NUMBER.
Submit button sends a http get request to the database server and if the code exists, the server returns with the details that are assigned to the specific code/hotel. The next screen is 3 buttons that send sms and email to the details that are assigned to the code the user sent with the form in the first screen.
The code to send verification and contact with me is 123456
